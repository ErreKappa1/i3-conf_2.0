# i3-conf_2.0 [blkabsol]

New version of my i3-gaps config, it's minimal but extremely productive and easy to use (once learned the keybindings)

This config is about i3-gaps, but the bar and the program launcher are external programs, so you will need some other 
	software to exactly copy my configuration. I'll put a list of those software somewere.

There's also an README_USAGE.txt file that explain what to do to use this config

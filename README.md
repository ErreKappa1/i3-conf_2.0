# i3-conf_2.0
New version of my i3-gaps config, It's minimal, that's it


This config works with i3-gaps, it also require
-Rofi (a program launcher)
-Unclutter (to enable pointer trasparency when not in use)
-Xinput (for keybord & mouse settings)
-Xfce4-terminal (it's just a terminal, use whatever you want asd)
-Polybar (a status bar that i find superior to standard i3-bar, config included)
-Gnome-screenshot (just a screenshot tool)
-PCmanFM (a graphical file manager, im lazy af)
-Feh (an image visualizer, just for background)

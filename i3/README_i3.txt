The config doesen't need anything more to work correctly, if you want to set up your wallpaper you have to edit the 
config file (search for 'Desktop background' an then just set the path to your image)
Also, ive recently added a new ROFI theme, to chose a different ROFI theme you only have to uncomment the matching line

NB: In this configuration there are some absolute path to scripts, files and configuration, you likely have to edit 
	those line adding the reference to YOUR files and scripts
